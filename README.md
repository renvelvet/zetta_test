## Basic Knowledge on Back End

1. Give a list of advantages of Node.js
   - It was good for programmers who comfort using Javascript so they don't need to learn a new language if they want to develop the server-side.
   - Have a huge and active number of user.
   - Open-source so there are many packages available made by Node.js programmer too.
2. Give an explanation about Synchronous & Asynchronous
   - Synchronous means that tasks are executed in sequential, one task needs to be done before another task.
   - Asynchronous means that we can do a task at the same time with another task when there is a condition where one task needs more time to be executed than others so we can use this async capability.
3. What is a module in Node.js?
   Module in node.js has had some functions as a library. which is the list of code made by someone to do the task that is regularly used by the programmers or as simple as help programmers to do their task in a more easy and efficient way.
4. Give an explanation about callback
   The callback is the function that will be called if the condition is fulfilled.
5. What are array iterator functions in JavaScript?
   As far as I know, we can use **forEach** to iterate item in array according to the number of array elements
6. What is the differentiation between SQL & NoSQL (at high level)?
   - SQL refers to a relational database, the database type that the column in the table has a strong relation and strict form to operate.
   - NoSQL refers to a non-relational database, the database type that has more flexibility to manage the database usually in object form and has key-value pairs.
7. What is MongoDB?
   MongoDB is one of example that implement NoSQL
8. What is index in MongoDB?
   I don't remember if I have or not implement the index on MongoDB. But the index is usually used for optimized searching jobs.
9. What is Document & Collection in MongoDB?
   In popular terms, collection acts as table in the database, and documents are rows of the table.
10. What Data Types are supported in MongoDB?
    From [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_datatype.htm), I know that MongoDB support these data types: Array, String, Object, Timestamps, Integer, Boolean, Double, Null, Symbol, Data, Binary Data, Code, Regex, Object ID, and Min/Max keys \(data type I never heard before\)
